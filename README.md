# Flight Prediction Model

## Overview
The Flight Prediction Model predicts whether a flight will be delayed based on various features such as weather conditions, flight carrier, and historical data. The goal is to help passengers and airlines plan better and minimize the inconvenience caused by delays.

This model utilizes machine learning algorithms to classify flights as either on-time or delayed, offering real-time prediction capabilities.

## Objective
Develop a model that predicts flight delays using machine learning. The model will take in multiple features and predict the likelihood of a delay, which can be useful for passengers and airlines in planning and operational efficiency.

## Requirements

### Software Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for interactive development)
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

### Hardware Requirements:
- No specific hardware is required other than a standard computer to run Python.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nabajit-Das/Flight-Predication-Model.git
   cd Flight-Predication-Model
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

### Results
The trained model can predict flight delays with high accuracy. Based on the trained model, you can input flight data and receive a prediction of whether the flight will be delayed or not, and by how much.
**Sample Output**
```bash
Model Accuracy: 92.57%
Predicted Delay: 15 minutes
